Hello World! I'm new in all this programming thing and i'm very excited to learn a lot on here!
I'm looking forward to learn Java,Phyton and any p. language i came acros!! And learn to program bots, and useful apps for everyone

I really hope that I learn in here because i've trying so hard to do it 
but  I can never focus on what I'm doing.

I'm gonna leave this as a proof from where i started, and look on the future all that I achieved
